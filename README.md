**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

  The Gaming Room created a mobile game called Draw It or Lose It. The Gaming Room wanted to develope a web-based version of the game in order to make it available across different platforms.
  
**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

  I provided a detail oriented executive summary outlining the critical information regarding my proposed development process. I also identified the various design constraints for this particular proposal.
  
**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

  I found the UML diagram to be the most helpful when developing the code for this project. Being able to see the various relationships between the classes and class elements gave me a better understanding of the desired functionality of the code.
  
**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

  I would revise the Recommendation section of the document. I would improve this section by adding more details about the security of the game itself, such as user authentication. 
  
**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

  Per the client's request, the goal of the software was to maintain the look and feel of the existing mobile game. This is important as the user's experience directly affects the success of the software. When designing software based on existing software, it is important that the new software has a similar design to maintain familiarity amongst existing users while also appealing to new users.
  
**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

  When designing software, it is important to initially focus on the client's requests and objectives for the software. From there, I was able to break down those requirements in to more specfic details in order to ensure they were met. I beleive this approach of starting with broad details and breaking each of them down into more detail allows you to focus on the various pieces of the software, then put them all together to make complete, well designed software.
